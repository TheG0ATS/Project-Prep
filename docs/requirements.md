## Vision

### What is the vision of this product?
Do or doom is an application to help users be motivated to complete their To Do lists. It organizes tasks, track deadlines, and logs completion status. We wanted to make a fun way to create notes and include accountability partners.

### What pain point does this project solve?
Writing a to do list can be hard and keeping up with one can prove to be an even harder task. We wanted to give users the opportunity to create importance in their check list by creating a sense of urgency in completing tasks.

### Why should we care about your product?
Our origional goal was to create an app for those with symptoms off add/adhd but we decided to ad some fun and flair to make it more universally appealing.

## Scope (In/Out)

### IN
  - Lists out tasks items with full crud features.
  - Login authentication.
  - List items are organized and divided into separate lists for easy viewing.
  - A counter is provided in a top level element that tracks the number of tasks in a list.
  - If a task is not completed within the time of due, a text message will be sent to an accountability partner.

### OUT
  - The app will not spam users or their partners with accountability texts.
  - the app is not ios or android compatible.

## Minimum Viable Product:
### MVP Functionality
As an MVP we want our app to be able to display created task items, delete them, and update them. Wealso want an authentication feature that is used to only give specific users their listed tasks.

### Stretch Goals:
  - Add a calendar feature
  - divide task lists by date
  - More log in features

## Functional Requirements
- An admin can create and delete user accounts
- A user can view all of the tasks in the inventory
- A user has full crud functionality of their tasks

## Data Flow
1. user authentication
2. create list items with form
3. display lists
3. update list items
4. delete list items
5. uncompleted items send text msg to accountability partner

## Non-Functional Requirements:
Our app is very secure because users need to be manually authenticated to create an account with us.
Our app is highly usable and versatile because you can list any number of tasks and describe them in whichever way a user finds most helpful.
